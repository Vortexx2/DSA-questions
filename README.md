# DSA Questions

- This repository contains solutions for various Data Structures And Algorithms Questions across multiple websites. It aims to not only let people see what are some of the various approaches one can use to solve a problem, but also the evolution of problem solving a person goes through when learning the algorithms required.
- Currently, the repository is heavily focused on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), but there are a few solutions to some questions from other websites as well.

# Contributions
- Feel free to open a pull request to contribute to any already existing problem with a new approach, or any other problem not attempted yet.
- Make sure to include a comment on the top of your file (refer to any solution file to see an example) with your username, description of your approach, and runtime and memory complexities.
- Pull requests with documentation or correction of these complexities will also be accepted, preferrably with an explanation.
